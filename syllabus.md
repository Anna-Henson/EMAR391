## Course Summary 
This course offers a “big picture” introduction to the possibilities offered by virtual reality, and discusses the broader universe of augmented, and mixed reality (colloquially called XR or ‘extended reality’ by some). We will introduce the concepts & vocabulary of this new media and investigate its intersection with other established disciplines including human-computer interaction, user experience, cognitive and social psychology, theatre, and game design. This class is both theoretical and practical, emphasizing the ability to think deeply about the why and not simply the how. The course has no prerequisites other than the Emerging Media Arts (EMA) major. The Carson Center will provide each student one HP Reverb G1 VR headset for the duration of the semester. This course will be taught remotely but synchronously, meeting both on Zoom and in a social VR application. 

In this class, we will work to understand both the opportunities and challenges of virtual reality, while learning to creatively problem-solve its present-day technological limitations. The coursework includes a mixture of reading, writing, active listening, critical discussion, and creative assignments. We will examine the attributes of popular VR applications and use this knowledge to build small, lightweight prototypes in Unity and Mozilla Hubs. 3D content creation is not a focus of this class, however we will construct new environments from existing asset sources (e.g. the Unity Store, Sketchfab, etc). We will emphasize the need to be a generalist when prototyping VR experiences early in the course, but learn to value specialization as we come together as a VR design studio in the final weeks of the class. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of new technologies for social activities, productivity, and learning. As part of a Carson Center research initiative, some of this class will be held within VR via Mozilla Hubs. Internet-based social VR is fraught with virtual harassment from problematic users. Our goal in this class will be to collectively understand how to make our own virtual space an adaptable, trusting, private, and engaging setting for learning & collaboration. We will also look at identifying and mitigating problematic behaviors from anonymous actors when designing new social experiences. 
Some time in the class will be dedicated to understanding how virtual reality crosses streams with other media like filmmaking and video games. Notably, we will look at historical and contemporary trends in non-VR massively multiplayer games including Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox and compare them to social VR applications like Altspace, RecRoom, VRChat, and more. 

By the end of this class students should be fluent in the major themes of augmented and virtual reality, including several advanced topics like perception and ethics.. Virtual and augmented reality is a nascent medium with abundant connections (and dependencies) to other disciplines. No student is expected to master all aspects of designing & developing for XR within the scope of this course; however, this class is designed to instill a swath of practical knowledge and creative inspiration through reading, critical discussion, hands-on projects, and practice-based research.Students are expected to be self-motivated in exploring online learning resources (articles, guides, tutorials, etc) and experimenting with third-party AR/VR apps and tools. 

## Typical Topics Covered 

* Why does XR matter and why should you care? What is VR good for, and what can be done in VR that cannot be done with any other type of media? How is it different from 360-degree video content? 
* Projecting into the future: how does XR change the job market? What new opportunities or roles does it open? How and why has it historically failed? 
* How can we understand the priorities of platform owners (like Facebook) and the major ethical considerations of building apps in “walled gardens” where users are the product? How does the open web change this equation? 
* What is the meaning of all the different acronyms including XR, AR, VR and MR? 
* What are the limitations of current-generation platforms? How do we deal with major limitations like cybersickness?
* How can we express complex ideas with low-to-medium fidelity prototypes? 
* What are the elemental interaction techniques in VR? What is the gestural language of VR? What are the major differences between hand tracking (e.g. Oculus Quest) and controller input (e.g. most headsets)? How do we approach basic interactions like grabbing, throwing, and pointing? 
* What are the major components of a 3D environment, and how do we create a pipeline from content authoring, assembly, and publishing (e.g. Maya to Unity to the Oculus Store)?
* What makes an XR experience interesting, fun, engaging, or immersive? How can we critically analyze the art, environment, interactions, and functionality of XR apps? 
* How are terms like agency, embodiment, and presence used to evaluate immersive experiences? 
* How do connected experiences (social VR) factor into the big picture?
